# Printing Objects

# Basic Printing

```python
print("My name is Russell Helmstedter, and my age is 35.")
```

# Printing with Objects

```python
name = "Russell Helmstedter"
print(name)

age = 35
print(age)
```

# String Concatenation

```python
name = "Russell Helmstedter"
age = "35"
print("My name is " + name + ", and my age is " + age + ".")
```

# f-strings

The f stands for formatted string.

```python
name = "Russell Helmstedter"
age = "35"
print(f"My name is {name}, and my age is {age}.")
```

# Compare

Without f-strings:

```python
name = "Russell Helmstedter"
age = 35
print("My name is " + name + ", and my age is " + str(age) + ".")
```

With f-stings
```python
name = "Russell Helmstedter"
age = 35
print(f"My name is {name}, and my age is {age}.")
```
