# While Loops

# Syntax

```python
while conditional:
    indent body of loop
```

# Infinite `while` loops

```python
while True:
    print("hello world")
```

# Working with infinite loops

Python offers two keywords: 

- **break**: if you reach this keyword exit the loop
- **continue**: if you reach this keyword return to the top of the loop
