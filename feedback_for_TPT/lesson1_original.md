# Assigning Objects

## Welcome to Our New Bites, it's time to learn the basics of python! Ready? Let's dive straight in.

The first thing you’ll need to learn is how to assign data to an object.

What’s an object? Technically, in Python, everything is an object! But let’s keep it simple. An object in this case is simply something we can store stuff in. Think of it like a cardboard box.

In Python, we can create an object (cardboard box) and give it any name we want. Let’s use your age for example. If we want to assign your age to an object we might be inclined to name our object my_age.

See how descriptive that is? By reading the name of this object we instantly know exactly what it’s storing!

To assign your age to this object you use the = operator. No, it’s not an equals sign here! It’s an assignment operator. Anything on the right of the = operator is assigned to whatever is on the left.

Based on this, we can then assign your age to the my_age object using the following code:
```python
my_age = 14
```
And there you have it, your first object in Python containing your very own age.Now it’s your turn!

Think of an object and assign data to it using an operator. Write your answer here:

Don’t forget to implement what you’ve learned in this Bite by actually doing some coding. If your school has an active subscription to the School Tier on the Pybites Platform, you can solve an exercise to cement your knowledge here: https://codechalleng.es/bites/256/newbie
