# Assigning Objects

The first thing you’ll need to learn is how to assign data to an object. What’s an object? Well, in Python, everything is an object! 

We can think of an object as a cardboard box with a label. We can store data in that box and access the data in the box by using the label.

Let’s use your age for example. You can create an object labeled `my_age` and assign it the value 10 by typing it as shown below:
```python
my_age = 14
```
No, that's not an equals sign! In python, `=` is the assignment operator. It creates an object by assigning the value on the right of the `=` the label on the left. By choosing the label carefully we know exactly what it’s storing!

## Now it’s your turn!

Think of an object and assign data to it using the assignment operator `=`. Perhaps it could be how many pets you have, or how many brothers and sisters you have.
