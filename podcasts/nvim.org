* My Journey to vim
** Finding an Editor
I was using atom, playing around with jupyter not realizing the full potential. I've always been drawn to data science because it is so closely related to the math I teach.
** An unlikely path
I was looking into zettelkasten as a note taking solution for my master's program.
* Why I Made the Switch
I don't truly remember. I was on the vim subreddit and this guy called Prime answered a question. So I started watching The Primeagen on youtube.
** PDE vs IDE
Tj is one of the core developers. He has this youtube video on his rational for choosing nvim.
* Transitioning from vim -> nvim
** Going Full lua
I treated this as a challenge for myself.
* My Python Workflow
** LSP
** autocomplete
** telescope
** harpoon
** salary comparison
** data science demo
